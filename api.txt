seedinteger

Random seed. Set for reproducible generation
imageuri

Input image for img2img pipeline
promptstring

Prompt for generated image
go_fastboolean

Run faster predictions with additional optimizations.

Default
    true

guidancenumber

Guidance for generated image. Lower values can give more realistic images. Good values to try are 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5

Default
    3
Maximum
    10

strengthnumber

Strength for img2img pipeline

Default
    0.9
Maximum
    1

image_sizestring

Image size for the generated image

Default
    "optimize_for_quality"

lora_scalenumber

Determines how strongly the main LoRA should be applied.

Default
    1

aspect_ratiostring

Aspect ratio for the generated image

Default
    "16:9"

lora_weightsstring

Load LoRA weights. Only works with text to image pipeline. Supports arbitrary .safetensors URLs, tar files, and zip files from the Internet (for example, 'https://huggingface.co/Viktor1717/scandinavian-interior-style1/resolve/main/my_first_flux_lora_v1.safetensors', 'https://example.com/lora_weights.tar.gz', or 'https://example.com/lora_weights.zip')
output_formatstring

Format of the output images

Default
    "webp"

enhance_promptboolean

Enhance the prompt with positive magic.
output_qualityinteger

Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs

Default
    80
Maximum
    100

negative_promptstring

Negative prompt for generated image

Default
    " "

num_inference_stepsinteger

Number of denoising steps. Recommended range is 28-50, and lower number of steps produce lower quality outputs, faster.

Default
    30
Minimum
    1
Maximum
    50

disable_safety_checkerboolean

Disable safety checker for generated images.
Output schema

Type
    uri[]
